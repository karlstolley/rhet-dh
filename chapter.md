“The greater the range and intenseness of the opportunities for the exercising of our symbolic prowess, the greater might be our delight in such modes of action.” Kenneth Burke, “Rhetoric and Poetics,” *Language as Symbolic Action*, p. 297

Let me open with the major premise of my argument: programming is writing. I mean that literally. Yes, “programming is writing” is not infrequently uttered in the metaphorical sense. And I agree with programmer Steve McConnell who dismisses writing as “the most primitive metaphor for software development.” But the metaphor fails among programmers because it is based on a mythologized understanding of what writing is. Among McConnell’s observations:

  * “[writing] doesn’t require any formal planning, and you figure out what you want to say as you go”
  * “writing is usually a one-person activity”
  * “in writing, a high premium is placed on originality. In software construction, [originality] is often less effective than focusing on the reuse of design ideas, code, and test cases from previous artifacts”
  * “when you finish writing a letter, you stuff it into an envelope and mail it. You can’t change it anymore”

As rhetoricians, we recognize the mythology surrounding McConnell’s observations. Writing may not require formal planning, but as even the introductory-writing student quickly discovers, that’s an unstudied and ineffective way to proceed. We know that writing is collaborative, on some level, always. And from citation practices to genre features, writers have a wide foundation upon which “originality” is built. To write is to engage in intelligent, ethical (i.e., non-plagiarized) reuse of “previous artifacts.”

Granted, in certain forms of writing on certain occasions, change becomes impossible, or at least very difficult, in the way McConnell suggests. But even digital writing, which rhetoric’s own digital mythos counts as infinitely mutable, fares no better when it comes to revision and ongoing change. As I have argued elsewhere, one-off digital invention--as in the first (and typically, only) stab at even a basic web page--will have to suffice in the digital rhetorical act. There is simply too much risk involved in revision. Correcting one problem, especially through the ubiquitous WYSIWYG interface that outputs code on behalf of the writer, spirals into a game of Whack-a-Mole, introducing new problems whose solutions introduce still other problems.

## Magic & Programming

Decades before Steve Jobs pronounced the iPad to be a magical device, Arthur C. Clarke had already suggested that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” It is no feat of imagination to see the magic inherent in multitouch interfaces, retina displays, ubiquitous high-speed internet connectivity, and other hardware-based wonders introduced over the last decade.

But the magical incantation of the written word in one programming language or another is what makes the magic. Jay David Bolter observed in 1991 a simple fact that is all but forgotten today: “Even a graphics program does not draw: it writes.” In a time before the introduction of Microsoft Windows 3.1 and the mouse-and-GUI model of interaction that that operating system would make ubiquitous, Bolter could confidently proclaim what is less obvious today: “All computing is reading and writing. The computer is therefore a technology for all writers--scientists and engineers as well as scholars, novelists, and poets” (10).

Recalling the scene from *The Matrix* where Neo announces to Tank from inside The Construct that he needs “Guns. Lots of guns,” digital designer John Maeda reflects on “the sense of magic that occurs when Neo expresses his wish. The instantaneous rush of tremendous resources, as visualized in the simple special effect of this scene, epitomizes for me the experience of freedom when programming the invisible spaces of computer codes” (*Creative Code*, 17).

“Even in our nonmagical world, magic remains a conceptual construct for appraising the powers of language,” writes William Covino in *Magic, Rhetoric, and Literacy*, “and while magic is understood by some as a liberatory alternative to established rationalism, the prospect of a magical epistemology is a fearful one even for those who endorse literacy as a disruptive force” (5).

Whenever I speak to rhetoricians and writers about writers programming, I can practically touch the fearful tension radiating from much of my audience. Programming presents itself as magic to the uninitiated. I have witnessed that even just the prospect of programming can arrest into silent hostility rhetoricians and writers who otherwise “endorse literacy as a disruptive force” (Covino) and who ostensibly delight in ever greater “range and intenseness” of symbolic activity (as Burke suggests in the epigraph to this chapter).

In what Covino calls “arresting magic,” programming would indeed by conjured only by a particular magus, the programmer, whose spells and incantations (from word processors to smart phones) represent “the imposition of the powerful few upon the unquestioning many” (8).

Elsewhere, magic presents itself in another sense: “the practice of disrupting and critiquing articulate power: a (re)sorcery of spells for generating multiple perspectives.” Noting that “generative magic enters the world it questions,” however, Covino argues that “generative magic is at once private and public, occult and common, an esoteric critical discourse of ‘specialist’ communities that define themselves in opposition to the mainstream, and an amplification of the possibilities for action.”

A fully realized, nuanced digital rhetoric is arrested by the WYSIWYG interface.

In maintaining for at least the scope of this chapter a nonmetaphorical meaning in “programming is writing,” I am also beholden to a particular rhetoric of the Burkean flavor of symbolic action raised in the epigraph above. Wildly reducing the nuanced complexities of the Burkean system, I maintain that rhetoric is the artful manipulation of symbols “to form attitudes or to induce actions” by and among human agents.

In fact, I don’t think any more nuanced rhetoric of programming is possible at the moment. What is so obviously lacking among people who cannot consider themselves programmers is a sense of the “artful manipulation of symbols” that constitutes writing code. What we have in the field of rhetoric, and in the digital humanities more broadly, is magic, not rhetoric, when it comes to the symbolic power of computer languages.



The problem is, widespread fear of programming among non-programmers is rampant; and with it, an overconfident sense of what does and does not constitute the scope and work of rhetoric.

I’ll conclude this section with a quote from Giambattista Vico cited in Covino:

    > [A]nyone who is confident of perceiving something in a clear and distinct idea of the mind
    > is easily deceived, and he will often think he knows a thing distinctly when he still has
    > only a confused consciousness of it...

To use another quote, here is  In contenting itself with an arresting magic/rhetoric of programming, the field of rhetoric and the broader humanities alike cuts itself off from the possibilities of a generative rhetoric

But I am talking here about writing code right alongside or in service to natural languages. More than 30 years of visual interfaces standing between writers and language (computer and natural) have helped to diminish awareness of the critical symbolic activity happening just beneath even the touch-screen on an iPad.

“Making language has long been regarded as, in some sense, magical,” writes William Covino in *Magic, Rhetoric, and Literacy*,  “as a *spell* (spelling, even in its ostensibly nonmagical sense, denotes the visible materialization of invisible thought...). --William Covino, 5

For the magus, words transform reality, and facility with language makes multiple realities possible. (Covino 6)

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. --Arthur C. Clarke
