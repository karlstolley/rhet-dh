Making language has long been regarded as, in some sense, magical; as a *spell* (spelling, even in its ostensibly nonmagical sense, denotes the visible materialization of invisible thought...). --William Covino, 5

For the magus, words transform reality, and facility with language makes multiple realities possible. (Covino 6)

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. --Arthur C. Clarke

Bill Covino’s (1994) *Magic, Rhetoric, and Literacy* is a wide-ranging treatment of magic and rhetoric. And yet nowhere in the book does Covino discuss technology or Clarke’s Third Law, which any sci-fi geek can recall from memory (as I did when composing the first draft of this chapter, and I can barely lay claim to the title of “sci-fi geek”).

For those unfamiliar with the work, *Magic, Rhetoric, and Literacy* is partially an exploration of binaries: articulate and inarticulate power; official and unofficial literacies; arresting and generative discourse; product and process; magic and rhetoric.
