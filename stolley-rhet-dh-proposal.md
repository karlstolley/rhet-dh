MVC, Maker Culture, and the Magus: The Rhetoric of Source-Level Production

In this proposed chapter, I will connect three concepts that I believe are central to understanding
the intellectual work of source-level production (programming) as a rhetorical act that binds the
field of rhetoric with broader, production-oriented pursuits in digital humanities.

The three concepts are:

* Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture: In many ways an opportunity to build on Hart-Davidson’s (2005) rhetoric of objects, relationships, and views, MVC as implemented through the web-based development framework Ruby on Rails provides a rigorous, rule-bound study of the key components of source-level production. With its nearly fanatical devotion to MVC and construction in the object-oriented Ruby language, Rails presents an important alternative to the mishmash of PHP scripts, plugins, and themes that mark WordPress, Drupal, Omeka, and other go-to frameworks and systems in DH projects.

* Maker Culture: Although “maker culture” has been a trajectory of attack on the DH from none other than the Modern Language Association, DH

* The Magus:
